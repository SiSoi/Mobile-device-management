Laboratory task 1: Call Detail Record

In this work, it is necessary to implement the simplest tariffing rule for services of the “Telephony” type in total quantity.
The work includes 2 stages:
Parsing a CDR file and selecting the necessary lines for processing
and Tariffing of selected records.

Telephony service tariffing rules:
X = T * K
where X is the total cost of all calls of subscribers, T is the total duration of all calls on the subscriber database, k is the multiplier of the tariff plan (each option has its own).

SMS tariffication rules:
Y = N * k,
where Y is the total cost of all SMS subscribers, N is the total number of SMS (the sum of the number of all SMS in subscribers upon request), k is the tariff plan multiplier (each option has its own).

The folder Program consists of the laboratory coding work for the task, and the other folder - Report - contains reports on laboratory task 1.
