Laboratory 2: Processing and tariffing NetFlow traffic                                      

In this work, NetFlow v5 traffic processing is assumed.

The work includes 3 stages: Parsing CSV files from a sample NetFlow v5 data, Tariffing the selected records and Creating a network traffic graph.

Rules for tariffing Internet services: X = Q * k where X is the total cost, Q is the total amount of NetFlow traffic for the                                             
reporting period, k is the tariff plan multiplier.                                                      

The folder Program consists of the laboratory coding work for the task, and the other folder - Report - contains reports on laboratory task 2.
